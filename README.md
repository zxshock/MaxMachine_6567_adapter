Documentation is "okayish". Uploaded completely "as is", since I lost all interest in the Commodore community.
Uploaded for your personal enjoyment. If I see this advertised as "r@r3 l@@k - high quality Repro of a long lost expansion!!!!!!11one" for 50â‚¬+ on eBay I sincerely hope you're getting the customers you deserve :)
The same circuit/blank PCB is also available with a different layout for a fair price at "Retro Innovations" / "go4retro"
